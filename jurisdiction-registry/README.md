# Jurisdiction Registry

Governments register MPA boundaries
  - Upload file with Geojson FeatureCollection - polygons of MPA boundaries.
  - Arweave deploy (+ IPFS?) (https://medium.com/@arweave/arweave-ipfs-persistence-for-the-interplanetary-file-system-9f12981c36c3)
  - Register IPFS address and / or arweave reference within smart contract (`JurisdictionRegistry.sol?`).
  - *Graphical interface - form fill / file drop basically*

## Development Plan

### MVP

Contracts to enable countries to register geometries representing restricted areas.

 - Arweave permaweb (with IPFS address?)
 - Written to smart contract
    - Node cloud program fetches Arweave or IPFS addresses from contract, then loads GeoJSON.

#### Deployments:


On the command line (with `arweave deploy` installed - (here)[https://docs.arweave.org/developers/tools/arweave-deploy]), calling:

```bash
arweave deploy ./exclusion-areas/paris.json --key-file ./path/to-arweave-keyfile.json --ipfs-publish
```

generated the following in the terminal window:

  }
};

```






### v2.0

Front end interfaces enabling government representatives to upload and administer jurisdictional boundaries.

- Update boundary polygons
- Update policies enforced on trusted sensors detected within boundaries.
    - Tax rates
    - Temporal restrictions - penalties applied based on time of day



## Research / Background

[London](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge/congestion-charge-zone)

[Berlin](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/berlin-environmental-zone): Since 01/01/2008, Berlinâ€™s city centre has had a designated environmental zone in which only vehicles that meet certain emission standards are allowed be driven. Vehicles that are used in the environmental zone must have a **sticker** that identifies its pollutant group. (Geojson generated by hand based on [this map](https://www.berlin.de/senuvk/umwelt/luftqualitaet/umweltzone/download/Umweltzone_Beikarten_1-10_druck.pdf))

Paris. There is [supposedly](https://blog.greenflag.com/2017/drivers-travelling-to-france-require-an-emissions-sticker-to-enter-paris-lyon-or-grenoble/) a congestion zone but couldn't find any maps or geometries. Made this one up just for demo purposes.
